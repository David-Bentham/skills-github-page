title: Why I'm on Github

### Why a civil servant is learning to code
A small experiment to show that a humanities (liberal arts) major can self-teach the technical skills to deliver rudimentary software that has analytical value in the workplace, at no cost to government.   

Over 12 months, my aim is to tinker my way to the following practical demonstration projects:
- [ ] Using python, analyse the World Food Programme Hunger Map and the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) to explore the relationship between food insecurity and conflict incidents.
- [ ] Using python and natural language processing (NLP), analyse sentiments towards conflict in national/state press as a potential early warning indicator.
- [ ] Using plotly/dash, create an interactive dashboard to track the impact of global health crises on security and stability in a given region.

My general aims are for each project to come with clear documentation, data sources, and a Github repository that other tinkers in government tech can borrow from.
